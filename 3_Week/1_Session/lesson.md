# Week Three: Session 1
### Housekeeping
##### Solo Projects
Kudos to those of you posting your Solo Project videos!  This is optional, but it's a great chance to show off your work.
##### Group Projects
I sent out group assignments over the weekend.  If you haven't done so already, start a group chat in MM with your assigned group to begin the process of nailing down a project plan. 
### Lecture: Recursion

- "Base Case" is your loop condition
- Each function call gets your closer to your base case
- But first... a basic review of functions/returns
#### Challenge(s): 
- sigma (sum of numbers)
- SLL size (recursive)
- SLL displayValues(recursive)
